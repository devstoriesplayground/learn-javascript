// In JavaScript, null is a special value that represents empty or unknown value.

// that typeof returned "object" for the null type. 
// This is a known issue in JavaScript since its first release.
console.log(typeof null); // object

// you can use null to assign 'unknown' or 'empty' value to a variable
let a = null;
